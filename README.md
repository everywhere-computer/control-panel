    <p class="text-align: center;"><strong>The ODD SDK is alpha software.</strong></p>
    <p>We recommend you <u>do not develop production applications using the ODD App Template</u> at this time. We're working on making it reliable, fast, and awesome, but we're not there yet!</p>

## ü§î What's The ODD SDK?

[The ODD SDK](https://github.com/oddsdk/ts-odd) empowers developers to build fully distributed web applications without needing a complex back-end. The SDK provides:

-   user accounts (via [the browser's Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)),
-   authorization (using [UCAN](https://ucan.xyz))
-   encrypted file storage (via the [ODD File System](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/odd/file-system-wnfs), backed by the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/), or IPFS)
-   and key management (via websockets and a two-factor auth-like flow).

ODD applications work offline and store data encrypted for the user by leveraging the power of the web platform. You can read more about the ODD SDK in Fission's [ODD SDK Guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/odd).

## üì¶ What does this template give me?

### ü•∞ Silky-smooth end-user flows

The ODD App Template provides a _silky-smooth user experience_ out of the box. Creating an account and linking a second device feels familiar, comfortable, and obvious. ODD SDK authentication is key-based rather than password-based, so we've focused heavily on the authentication flows, borrowing language and screens from two-factor auth flows.

### üß± Built with a modern web stack

The app template is built with modern web technologies:

-   [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) under the hood)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

### üë©‚Äçüè´ A simple ODD demo to learn from

![WNFS Image Gallery Screenshot](static/wnfs-gallery-screenshot.png)

The app template includes a functioning application: an image gallery. Check out the image gallery code to learn how an ODD application handles things like file uploads, directories, etc.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can try out the template yourself [here](https://odd-template.fission.app/).

Ready? Let's go.

Prerequiste: ensure you are running Node 16.14 or greater, but _not_ Node 17 (18 is fine though!).

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:oddsdk/odd-app-template.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the downloaded template directory:

    ```shell
    cd odd-app-template
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Start the local development¬†server:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

## üõ† Customize your app

The app template is designed to be easy for you to _make it your own._ Here's how:

1. Rename your application.

    In `/src/lib/app-info.ts`:

    - Change `appName` to the name of your app.
    - Change `appDescription` to a simple, 1-sentence description of your app.
    - Update `oddNamespace` with your project details.
    - Once you [deploy](#-deploy) your app, change `appURL` to the production URL.

    In `package.json`, change `name` to your application's name.

1. Customize your app's logo.

    - App Logo SVG can be customized in `/src/components/icons/Brand.svelte`. Target an image that is 35 pixels high.
    - Replace the favicon files in `/static` by following the instructions in [this blog post](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)
    - Generate a Twitter/Social Media Embed image.
        - In `/src/lib/app-info.ts`, change `appImageURL` to match the URL of your embed image.
        - In `/src/routes/+layout.svelte`, update `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` to the size of your embed image.

1. Customize the look and feel.

    The app template is built using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). You can customize basic theme colors by editing `/tailwind.config.css`. Check out the [DaisyUI Theme Generator](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/) to play around with theme colors or read the [customization guide](https://daisyui.com/docs/customize/) to customize the component appearance.

1. Clear out the app's home page.

    The home page content is in `/src/routes/+page.svelte`. Delete everything in the file (but don't delete the file!) to start over with a blank home page.

1. Remove the image gallery demo app code.

    If you're not building an image gallery, you don't need the gallery demo code, except perhaps to learn from. To get rid of it, delete:

    - `/src/routes/gallery`
    - the `initializeFilesystem` function in `/src/lib/auth/account.ts` creates directories used by WNFS. Change those to what you need for your app or delete them if you're not using WNFS.

üëè You're ready to start adding custom functionality! üöÄ

Check out the [ODD SDK Guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/odd) for ODD SDK questions or [UCAN.xyz](https://ucan.xyz) for UCAN questions.

## üìõ Usernames

When you go through the registration flow in WAT, the username you type in the form field has a `#{DID}` appended to it in the background. We did this to enable discord style usernames where users can share the same usernames, but have unique identifiers attached to the end to distinguish them from one another. We then create a hash of the `fullUsername`(the one with the `#{DID}` appended to the end) that is passed to the ODD SDK. So the ODD SDK only has a notion of the `hashed` username currently. This should also allow users to create usernames using emojis or non-English characters. Also, this is the only username schema that currently supports our File System recovery flow.

You don‚Äôt necessarily need to follow that same pattern though. If you were to register two of the same usernames in the app without hashing them, you would be able to call `session.authStrategy.isUsernameAvailable(username)` to ensure duplicate usernames aren't present in the app. We will be working on porting some of this functionality over to the `ts-ODD` library over the next while and we will be updating the docs to reflect that.

[Please take a look at our init function](https://github.com/oddsdk/odd-app-template/blob/main/src/lib/init.ts#L34-L38) to see how we are currently constructing the username schema.

## üß® Deploy
